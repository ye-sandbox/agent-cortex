## Release / Cycle Wrap-up (Not the next task)

Release/tag only with explicit human request. When triggered, the ID is `[99.1]`. Do not number feature, hygiene, or CI tasks as `99.x`. Do not calculate next task ID from this section.

## How to Keep this File Lean

1. Detail only in the active task. When complete $\rightarrow$ log one line and promote the next task.
2. Backlog is a list of titles. Full spec only when an item becomes the active task.
3. Next ID = last ID in log (or active task). Cycle wrap-up and `[99.1]`: see `AGENTS.md`.
